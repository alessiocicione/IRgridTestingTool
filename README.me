# Serial Data Acquisition Tool

This project is a desktop application written in Python and PyQt5. Its purpose is to connect to a device via serial to read, label, and save data streams in XML format.

It was developed to test and acquire data from a rain sensor prototype (thesis project A.Y. 2023-2024).

## Features

* **Section-based Test Management:** Allows running multiple tests in sequence, assigning a custom "tag" (label) to each section.

* **Data Saving:** The acquired data is saved in a structured `.xml` file for further reading and analysis.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git
